# R_Project_Socioeconomic_Factors

## Socioeconomic Factors in U.S. Census: An Analytical Approach

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project uses theÂ **Adult Census Income dataset**Â (44,993 observations, 14 attributes) to analyze socioeconomic and demographic predictors of income, specifically focusing on whether individuals earn more than $50,000 annually.

**Tools used:**Â R (tidyverse, stats, ggplot2, caret)

**Main focus:**Â Effect of marital status on income while controlling for other variables.

### ðŸ“Š Data Overview

- **Target Variable (pay):**Â Binary (0 = â‰¤50K, 1 = >50K)
- **Predictors:**
    - Categorical: marital, education, sex, race, workclass
    - Numeric: age, hours-per-week
- **Excluded variables:**Â fnlwgt, native-country, occupation, relationship, capital gain/loss (to reduce multicollinearity and improve interpretability).

---

### ðŸ”Ž Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Age**: Right-skewed, median â‰ˆ 37, max = 90.
- **Hours/week**: Centered at 40 hrs, slightly skewed right.
- **Income distribution**: Imbalanced (majority â‰¤50K).
- **Workclass**: Dominated byÂ *Private*.
- **Race**: MostlyÂ *White*, followed byÂ *Black*.
- **Marital status**: Married (22,863), NeverMarried (14,578), FormerlyMarried (7,552).

### ðŸ§® Logistic Regression Model

**Formula:**

```
pay_binary ~ marital + age + education + sex + race + workclass + hours_per_week
```

**Key Results:**

- **Marital Status**: Married â†’ strong positive predictor (Î² = 1.90, p < 0.001).
- **Education**: Advanced degrees (Masters, Doctorate, Prof-school) â†’ large positive coefficients.
- **Age**: Positive effect (Î² = 0.03 per year).
- **Sex**: Males more likely to earn >50K (Î² = 0.38, p < 0.001).
- **Race**: White significant (Î² = 0.53), others not significant.
- **Workclass**: Private and self-employed show lower odds than federal government jobs.
- **Hours worked**: More hours â†’ higher odds (Î² = 0.03, p < 0.001).

### ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: 81.8%
- **AUC**: 0.8663 (very good discrimination ability).
- **Confusion Matrix**: Balanced predictive performance.

---

### âœ… Conclusion

- Marital status is aÂ **key determinant**Â of income.
- Higher education, being male, older age, and working longer hours increase odds of high income.
- The model showsÂ **good predictive accuracy**Â and interpretability.
